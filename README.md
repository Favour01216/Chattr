# Chattr


#### Introduction

This repo consists of a **Chat Application** built with the MERN stack. I built this sometime back when I was trying to learn the stack and I have left it here for anyone new to the stack so that they can use this repo as a guide.
<br/><br/>
This is a full-stack chat application that can be up and running with just a few steps. 
Its frontend is built with [Charka IO](https://material-ui.com/) running on top of React.
The backend is built with Express.js and Node.js.
Real-time message broadcasting is developed using [Web Socket](https://socket.io/).
